                    <h1 class="aligncenter">Pros About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am an open-minded individual, with a passion for work, chasing opportunities, loving to help others and prioritizing my friends and family over everything if possible</p>
                    <h1 class="aligncenter">Cons About Me</h1>

                    <h1 class="aligncenter">Personal Goals</h1>
                    <p>Firstly, I want to care more about my self, starting by losing weight, I also want to focus more on programming and to learn micro-soldering and IoT/Smart Home Technologies</p>
                    <h1 class="aligncenter">Boring Slice Of Life Stuff</h1>
                    <p>I grew up with a passion about technology and gaming, and started computer/console repair for my personal devices but as I grew up, thanks to the closed society of Naxos, I followed my hobby as a job by myself and this summer I decided to work for a business as a head technician</p>
